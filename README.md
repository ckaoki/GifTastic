# GifTastic
This project contains a web page which pulls images using the GIPHY API and displays them to the user at the click of a button. The user may also create custom buttons to search GIPHY. This page was designed using Bootstrap and is responsive.

Overview
1. This web page contains a default set of search buttons that are created dynamically on document load.
2. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
3. Under each image its rating is displayed.
4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing. 
5. A form is used to take a value from a user input box and adds a new button to the topics array.
